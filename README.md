# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find the number of retiring employees by title/department as well as those who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Retiring employees by title will show the number of employees in each department who were born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955.

## Results
Retirement titles table was created in order to allow us to see the eligible employees for retirement and how long they've been working at each department.
Unique titles was created to view the most recent titles for employees at the retirement age.
Retiring titles, on the other hand, shows the majority of the employees at the retirement age that currently have senior titles.
Then, mentorship eligibility as said before, filtered in those who could participate in the program.
